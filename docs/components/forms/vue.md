## Import

### Use in entire app

```js
import { Forms } from '@warp-ds/vue';
app.use(Forms);
```

### Use in one component and special imports

```js
import { wInput, wSelect, wToggle, wForm, wField, wSuffix } from '@warp-ds/vue';
```

## Validation

### Validating Elements
Every form element accepts a prop `rules` which takes an array of functions. These functions will be run in order until one returns an object. If all functions return `true` the field is considered valid.

```js
[v => v.trim().length > 5 || { valid: false, hint: 'This should be longer' }]
```
The function has one argument, the current value of the form element â€” and can either return `true` or an object with attributes described below

### Collecting Validation with wForm
The `wForm` component registers element descendants at any level, and provides the aggregate validation status.

### Programatic validation
The `wField` component can provide access to programatic validation beyond what `wForm`'s props can. For information on which methods are available, see the documentation on Field.

```js
<w-field #control="{ form }">
  <button @click="submit(form)">Submit</button>
</w-field>
```

### Validation and `required` Form Elements
If the form element is marked `required`, a special rule will be inserted before any user-defined rules.
The `required` prop can accept a function that will be used as the required-rule.

## Props

<api-table type="vue" component="Forms" />
